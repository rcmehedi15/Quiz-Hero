        <h1>2. Local Storage and Session Storage Different</h1>

                <p>
                    <b>Local storage</b> maintains data across all instances of a site, whether they're in different
                    tabs or windows. It is also permanent, so the data won't disappear when you close your browser.

                    When you open a website that previously used local storage, it will always have access to that
                    stored data.
                </p>
            </fieldset>
            <br>
            <fieldset style="width: 50%;">
                <p><b>Session Storage</b> is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab
                    or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new
                    session and new storage.

        <h1>3. What is Event Loop and working process</h1>
        <fieldset style="width: 50%;">
            <p>
                The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on
                a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
            </p>

            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

        <h1>4. Quiz Time Function Working process</h1>
        <fieldset style="width: 50%;">
            <p>
                This code defines a function called quizTimer that takes in one parameter called dismiss.

                Inside the function, there is an if statement that checks if the value of dismiss is truthy (meaning
                it's
                not false, null, undefined, 0, NaN, or an empty string). If dismiss is truthy, the function calls
                clearInterval(timer) to stop the interval timer and then immediately returns, which means the rest of
                the
                function won't be executed.
            </p>
        </fieldset>
        <h1>5. Choose Time Function Working process</h1>

        <fieldset style="width: 50%;">
            <p>
                This code defines a function called chooseQuiz that takes in two parameters: index and givenAns.

                Inside the function, there is a variable called isExist that uses the find method to search through an
                array called answers. The find method takes in a function as an argument and returns the first element
                in the array that matches the condition specified in the function. In this case, the function checks if
                the id property of the element in answers is equal to the id property of the quiz data located at the
                given index in an array called quizData.
